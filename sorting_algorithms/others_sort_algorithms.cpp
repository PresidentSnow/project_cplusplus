// Some algorithms are slow compared to those discussed above, such as the
// bogosort with unbounded run time and the stooge sort which has O(n2.7)
// run time. These sorts are usually described for educational purposes to
// demonstrate how the run time of algorithms is estimated. The following
// table describes some sorting algorithms that are impractical for real-life
// use in traditional software contexts due to extremely poor performance
// or specialized hardware requirements.
