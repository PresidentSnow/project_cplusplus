This game is for simulate the combat between predator and alien.

The goal is to create an application that is a combat simulator based on the Alien vs Predator movies.

    ● The rules are:
        ○ Casting is prohibited.
        ○ Any function may be used.

    ● The rules of the game are:
        ○ The game world contains both aliens and predators.
        ○ All characters (GameObjects) have these characteristics and no others.
            ■ (A) Id (1-99): Integer. Immutable.
            ■ (A) Attack (1-10): Integer. Immutable. Influences melee
              attacks (to the neighboring square). Cannot change.
            ■ (A) Defense (10-20): Integer. Immutable. Influences dodging attacks. Cannot change.
            ■ (A) Hit Points (10-100): Integer. This is the amount of
              damage a character can take before falling in combat.

    ○ Regarding aliens, in addition:
        ■ Their attack deals 1-10 hit points.
        ■ (A) Speed (0-3). Integer. This is the number of extra actions
          an alien can perform on its turn. It is an attribute or property.
        ■ (C) Each turn they can:
            ● Attack

    ○ Regarding predators, in addition:
        ■ Their attack deals 1-5 hit points.
        ■ (E) 1-4 healing potions. Each of these restores a random number of 2-20 hit points.
        ■ (F) Disc. When the predator uses the disc, there is a 70% chance that the disc will return to
          the predator, and a 30% chance that it will be lost forever. This attack deals 1-10 hit points.
        ■ (E) Camouflage. This will last for 10 turns. While active, it will be harder for aliens to see
          it, meaning an alien has a 20% chance of seeing that predator that turn. After using it, it will
          have to go 5 turns without being able to use it. ■ (C) On each turn they can:
            ● (A) Attack.
            ● Use a potion.
            ● Attack with the disc.
            ● Activate camouflage.

The classes that must be implemented are the following:

    ● IBattlefield
        ○ (A) ObjectCount
        ○ (A) GetObjectAt(index)
        ○ (A) ExecuteTurn() → When a character's hit points
          reach 0, it must be removed from the battlefield
        ○ Visit(objects)

    ● IGameObject 
        ○ (A) ExecuteTurn(IBattlefield)
        ○ (A) AddLifePoints(int)
        ○ (A) GetAttack() → If it is an alien, 2 will be added (A) GetDefense() → If it is a predator, 2 will be added

    ● Battlefield
        ○ (A) There can't be 2 characters with the same id
        ○ (A) It has a list of IGameObject and absolutely nothing else
    ● GameObject
    ● Predator
    ● Alien

    ● Utils
        ○ (D) PrintBattlefield(battlefield) → will print the status of each 
          character (health, id, whether it's an alien or a predator, ...).

Notes 
    ● To resolve an attack, do the following: 
        ○ The attacker rolls a 20-point die (1-20).
        ○ Adds their attack power to their roll.
        ○ If the result is greater than or equal to the 
          opponent's defense, the attack is successful.
